# ── Per-database write serialization ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# SQLite permits exactly ONE writer per database file at a time, in WAL mode
# as much as any other. Before August 2026 every writer took a pooled
# connection FIRST and only then attempted `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so a thread
# that lost the race sat inside SQLite's busy handler (and the hand-rolled
# "database is locked" retry loop in execute_query) while still holding its
# pooled connection. On cold start — every subsystem creating tables and
# inserting at once — that reliably drained the flight_control_computer pool
# and surfaced as "[DBM] Timeout waiting for available connection", the
# long-standing open item in PLANNING.md.
#
# Writers now queue on a lightweight in-process mutex BEFORE acquiring a
# connection, so a blocked writer costs a lock wait instead of a pooled
# connection. This does not reduce write throughput: writes were already
# serialized by SQLite itself: it only moves the queue to where it is cheap
# and leaves the pool free for readers.
#
# Keyed by resolved db_path, not by system, because several systems share
# one file (default.db and radar_data.db each back multiple systems), and
# they must contend on the same mutex. RLock so that a thread which nests a
# write inside another write on the same database cannot deadlock itself.

        cause of the cold-start "[DBM] Timeout waiting for available
        connection" errors tracked in PLANNING.md):

          1. Non-blocking take from the pool — the common case.
          2. If the pool is empty but the pool is still allowed to GROW
             (connection_count < max_connections), create a connection
             immediately.
          3. Only when genuinely at capacity, block up to `timeout` seconds
             for another thread to return one.

        The original implementation did (3) BEFORE (2): it always blocked the
        full 5-second timeout first and only then considered growing the
        pool. With min=4/max=8 and a shared 20-worker executor, a cold-start
        burst (every subsystem creating tables and writing at once) meant the
        5th concurrent caller stalled a full 5s even though four more
        connections were permitted — the pool effectively grew at one
        connection per five seconds of stall, and once it did reach max every
        further caller raised. Trying the grow path first removes both the
        stall and the spurious saturation errors; a timeout now means the
        pool is really at capacity, which is worth surfacing.

            True when the column is present on return -- whether it was added
            now or already existed. False when it could not be ensured, which
            the caller must treat as the column being absent.

        Three defects made the previous version a silent no-op in every case:

        * The ALTER statement was built as
          ``f"[DBM] ALTER TABLE ..."`` -- the log prefix had been pasted inside
          the SQL string, so SQLite answered `near "[DBM]": syntax error` for
          every column it was ever asked to add.
        * The existence check was ``column_name.lower() in table_schema.lower()``,
          a substring match against the whole CREATE TABLE text. Asking for a
          column named `id` against a table with `request_id` reported it as
          already present; so did `at` against `rate`. Those calls returned
          early and never reached the broken SQL at all.
        * `sqlite3.OperationalError` was caught, logged, and the method returned
          normally, so a caller could not tell a failure from a success.

        Between them the column was never added and the caller was never told.
        The correct form of this was already in the codebase -- see
        Utils/common/paths.py, which uses PRAGMA table_info, emits valid SQL and
        re-raises -- written inline by someone who did not use this helper.
