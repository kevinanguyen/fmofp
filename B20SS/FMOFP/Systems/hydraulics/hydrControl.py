        Story C2.2/C2.3: this subsystem exposed none of health_report(),

        UNKNOWN for it -- "we never asked", indistinguishable from "we
        asked and it said yes" for any caller that treated UNKNOWN as
        benign. Measured before this change: 33 of 51 registered
        components, this one among them, reported UNKNOWN.

        The fact reported is the one this class already publishes from
        get_status(): whether its single daemon worker thread is alive.
        Nothing new is inferred about the aircraft.

        Note the polarity: self._running is a STOP event -- start()
        clears it and stop() sets it -- so a stop has been requested
        when it IS set. Reading the name as "is running" would invert
        this check.
